# Semi-gradient Sarsa in OpenAI Gym environments

* linear function approximation using tilecoder
* Solving OpenAI Gym environments MountainCar and CartPole (over 10k timesteps for cartpole)
* It seems it's not enough for LunarLander

Algorithm is from Sutton & Barto's RL Book

Tile coder is from http://incompleteideas.net/tiles/tiles3.html
